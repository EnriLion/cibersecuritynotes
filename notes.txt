--Diferences between grep and egrep--

--Using Sed to find a Replace--

*Search for the word mysql in the snort.conf file using grep, like so:*

$ cat /etc/snort/snort.conf | grep mysql

*Save the output in another file and  replace every occurence of mysql witth MySQL

$ sed /s/mysql/MySQL/g /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf

(Use sed to find an replace keyword and phrases)

/ = separated 
g =  globally
s = search
...................
s = search
%>> / mysql = we are searching mysql
%>>>>>>/MySQL = we are replacing with it

#Replace only the second occurence (word)

$ sed /s/mysql/MySQL/2 /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf

#For working  with scroll with larger files(more and less)

--Controlling the Display with more--

-> use "n" to highlight and search move between words

--usr/share/wordlist/metsaploit = directory of mutliple wordlist ( cand be used to brute force passwords in  various passowrd protected devices using Metasplit(most popular pentesting and hacking framework)

>>>>> there are not longer passwords.lst in the file instead of passwords is a tar file that contain more than 14 million passwords but you need to use gunzip to decompress the file to use it because is a long file of over 14 million passwords

Note: gunzip = Command reduces the size of named files to decompress it 

>>>>>> gunzip = is used to unzip files that have benn compressed with the gzip algorthm( lossless compression algorithm that reduces the size of a file without losing data)

>>>>>> tar -xvf = is used to extract only one or more files  and can be used to create list, and extract files from archives.

>> the difference betwen them is that gunzip extract everything and with that you could only extract one or do more.
