--Diferences between grep and egrep--

--Using Sed to find a Replace--

*Search for the word mysql in the snort.conf file using grep, like so:*

$ cat /etc/snort/snort.conf | grep mysql

*Save the output in another file and  replace every occurence of mysql witth MySQL

$ sed /s/mysql/MySQL/g /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf

(Use sed to find an replace keyword and phrases)

/ = separated 
g =  globally
s = search
...................
s = search
%>> / mysql = we are searching mysql
%>>>>>>/MySQL = we are replacing with it

#Replace only the second occurence (word)

$ sed /s/mysql/MySQL/2 /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf

#For working  with scroll with larger files(more and less)

--Controlling the Display with more--

-> use "n" to highlight and search move between words

--usr/share/wordlist/metsaploit = directory of mutliple wordlist ( cand be used to brute force passwords in  various passowrd protected devices using Metasplit(most popular pentesting and hacking framework)

>>>>> there are not longer passwords.lst in the file instead of passwords is a tar file that contain more than 14 million passwords but you need to use gunzip to decompress the file to use it because is a long file of over 14 million passwords

Note: gunzip = Command reduces the size of named files to decompress it 

>>>>>> gunzip = is used to unzip files that have benn compressed with the gzip algorthm( lossless compression algorithm that reduces the size of a file without losing data)

>>>>>> tar -xvf = is used to extract only one or more files  and can be used to create list, and extract files from archives.

>> the difference betwen them is that gunzip extract everything and with that you could only extract one or do more.

--3-Analyzing and managing networks--

Understanding networking is crucial for any aspiring hacker( a good hacker nees to know how to connect to and interact with that network understanding:

Internet Protocol(IP)
Domain Name System(DNS)
Media Access Control(MAC) 
Network Interface Card(NIC)
Boradcast Addresss...

--Analyzing networks with ifconfig--

ifconfig - to get network information
output:
1)ethoLinkencap:EthernetHWaddr 00:0c29:ba:82:of 
2)inet addr:192.168.181.131 3)Bcast:192.168.181.255 4)Mask:255.255.255.0
5)lo Linkencap: Local Loopback
inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0
--snip--
6)wlan0 Link encap:EthernetHWaddr 00:c0:ca:3f:ee:02
 IS short for Ethernet0( linux start counti at 0 rathern than 1) the ethener interfaces show up the same format(eth1, eth2 and so forth) and is listed followed by Haddr and the address is stamped on every piece of network NIC usually reffered to as the MAC address

2) contains the IP address is currently assigned to that network interface(192.168.131)

3)Broadcast Adress(Bcast) (address used to send out the information to all IPs on the subnet)
