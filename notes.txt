--Diferences between grep and egrep--

--Using Sed to find a Replace--

*Search for the word mysql in the snort.conf file using grep, like so:*

$ cat /etc/snort/snort.conf | grep mysql

*Save the output in another file and  replace every occurence of mysql witth MySQL

$ sed /s/mysql/MySQL/g /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf

(Use sed to find an replace keyword and phrases)

/ = separated 
g =  globally
s = search
...................
s = search
%>> / mysql = we are searching mysql
%>>>>>>/MySQL = we are replacing with it

#Replace only the second occurence (word)

$ sed /s/mysql/MySQL/2 /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf

#For working  with scroll with larger files(more and less)

--Controlling the Display with more--

-> use "n" to highlight and search move between words
